This pipeline is built on SPrime, which is a method for detecting the haplotypes in current-day populations that were introgressed from an archaic source in the past. 
In this pipeline, we detect Neanderthal and Denisovan introgression in 1000 Genomes Project data, specifically focusing on the CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing) population. For further details on the SPrime method, please refer to BROWNING et al. 2018
